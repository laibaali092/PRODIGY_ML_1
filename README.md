Introduction:

The prediction of house prices is a fundamental problem in real estate analytics and an excellent application of machine learning techniques. This project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as the square footage of the living area, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques," which provides a comprehensive set of features for each house. The main objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the sale prices of houses using a subset of the available features. By focusing on a few essential features, we simplify the model while still aiming for a reasonable level of prediction accuracy.
Challenges:

Challenges in this project include feature selection, handling missing values, data normalization and scaling, and avoiding overfitting and underfitting. Proper feature selection is crucial for building an effective model, requiring domain knowledge and exploratory data analysis. Missing values must be handled appropriately to maintain data integrity, either by filling them with statistics like mean or median or by removing affected rows. Normalizing and scaling features ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model. Balancing the model to avoid overfitting (learning the training data too well and performing poorly on unseen data) and underfitting (being too simple to capture underlying patterns) is essential. Choosing appropriate evaluation metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, is important for assessing the model's performance and interpreting results.

The project follows these steps to address challenges and build a robust linear regression model: data loading and exploration, feature selection, data cleaning and preprocessing, train-test split, model training, prediction and evaluation, and visualization. By following these steps, the goal is to build a predictive model that provides accurate estimates of house prices based on a few key features. The simplicity of linear regression, combined with careful handling of challenges, can yield valuable insights and predictions in the real estate domain.
